# CSC229-Minesweeper
The game of minesweeper. Uses an array of characters, integers and boolean. Perhaps it is best to think of 
these arrays of being stacked ontop of each other. Game logic isnt perfect as you seem to lose the game once 
and it is printed several times though i believe this is due to the simulation of several moves. 
It's more likely that it is my logic
